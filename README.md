# CSC 4899 - Senior Project

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    This project attempts to take the essence of platforms intended for creators to post and view original content (e.g. Pillowfort, Instagram, etc.) and combine it with web apps like Aggie.io or Google Jamboard, affording creators a space to both work together in real-time from anywhere, and to immerse themselves in the work of other creators.

    The project is motivated in part by a personal frustration Bailey has with the current state of social media for artists: it is nearly impossible to break out and have your work be seen, as the algorithmic changes made to socials like Instagram or Twitter favor creators that upload and engage with the site every single day, or who pay to promote their posts/boost  engagement, which is not manageable for some and is generally disingenuous. The ability to hop on a pop culture trend or event within the first day or two of its inception/explosion often determines your success, as your work on those sites is largely consumed by media orbiters as opposed to creators.

    By creating a site explicitly for people to Jam and foster creative communities, easily congregate their work, and chat with and link to collaborators, creators of all sizes and skill levels can enjoy a social media that doesnâ€™t just act as a blue-screened, infinite scroll time sink; rather, one that allows them to expose themselves to new work as both an audience and a participator, while simultaneously networking and growing their platform.
